# 🚨 URGENT API FIX - 404 Error Resolution

## 🔍 Problem Identified
The frontend is making API calls to the wrong URL:
- **Wrong**: `https://ieee-me-mishraji-ka-aatank-backend.onrender.com/search`
- **Correct**: `https://ieee-me-mishraji-ka-aatank-backend.onrender.com/api/search`

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Frontend API URL Fallback
- Updated `frontend/src/services/api.js` to use the correct backend URL as fallback
- Added debugging logs to help identify issues
- Now defaults to: `https://ieee-me-mishraji-ka-aatank-backend.onrender.com/api`

### 2. Backend CORS Configuration
- Enhanced CORS to explicitly allow your frontend domain
- Added multiple origins for development and production
- Added request logging for debugging

### 3. Environment Variable Setup
You need to set this environment variable in your Render frontend service:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://ieee-me-mishraji-ka-aatank-backend.onrender.com/api
```

## 🚀 Immediate Actions Required

### Step 1: Update Frontend Environment Variable on Render
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Open your frontend service: `ieee-me-mishraji-ka-aatank`
3. Go to "Environment" tab
4. Add this environment variable:
   - **Key**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://ieee-me-mishraji-ka-aatank-backend.onrender.com/api`
5. Save and redeploy

### Step 2: Update Backend Environment Variable on Render
1. Go to your backend service: `ieee-me-mishraji-ka-aatank-backend`
2. Go to "Environment" tab
3. Ensure these variables are set:
   - **Key**: `NODE_ENV` **Value**: `production`
   - **Key**: `PORT` **Value**: `10000`
   - **Key**: `FRONTEND_URL` **Value**: `https://ieee-me-mishraji-ka-aatank.onrender.com`
4. Save and redeploy

### Step 3: Test the API
1. Open the `test-api.html` file I created in your browser
2. Click "Test Health Endpoint" - should return status OK
3. Click "Test Search Endpoint" - should return research papers

## 🔧 Alternative Quick Fix
If environment variables don't work immediately, the code now has a hardcoded fallback to the correct URL, so redeploying the frontend should fix the issue.

## 🐛 Debugging
The updated code now logs:
- The exact URL being called
- API response status
- Error details

Check your browser console for these logs to verify the fix.

## 📞 Expected Result
After applying these fixes:
- ✅ Search should work and return research papers
- ✅ Paper details should load correctly
- ✅ No more 404 errors
- ✅ Console logs will show successful API calls

## ⚡ Quick Deploy Commands
If you have access to the repository, commit and push these changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix API URL configuration and CORS settings"
git push origin main
```

Both services should auto-deploy and the issue should be resolved!
